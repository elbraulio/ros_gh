They are setup to build dynamically linked libraries (.so on linux and .dylib on osx).  </p>\n\n<p>The way I see it there are a few ways to approach this setup in ROS: (Maybe there is a 4th, correct setup)</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Put a script in rosdep.yaml to (svn co; make; sudo make install) each of the libraries from IRI.\n<ul>\n<li>This is good because the libraries are installed and no further configuration is required, but requires root access</li>\n<li>Also, they install Find&lt;lib&gt;.cmake files in the cmake shared Modules folder, which is nice</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Create a ROS pkg for each library and use rosmake to build them, using the svn_checkout.mk make script and patches to build and install them to the pkg dir\n<ul>\n<li>This is nice because the libraries are contained in the ros pkg</li>\n<li>But, you need to export cpp flags to include and link directories</li>\n<li>How do you handle runtime dynamic linking?</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Download/Distribute and build the libraries in your ROS pkg and statically link your node to the libraries\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn't allow multiple nodes to link to a single source for the libraries (build the libs for each node that uses them)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So here are my questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What is the preferred method of build architecture?</li>\n<li>How do you handle dynamic linking at runtime? (the .so file is in package A, and how does a binary in package B find it at runtime?) </li>\n<li>How can you handle installing and referencing Find&lt;lib&gt;.cmake files that libraries have? (use manifext.xml's &lt;depend ...=\"\"/&gt; instead, is my guess)</li>\n<li>What if any licensing concerns are there? (patches and static linking, etc)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Sorry if some of these questions are silly, I am still learning these more complicated build systems (rosmake/cmake).</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advanced!</p>\n",
